 ## Description 
  Full Stack Burgers app is built with MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and a homemade ORM (yum!). The app follows the MVC design pattern, uses Node and MySQL to query and route data in the app, and Handlebars to generate the HTML.

  * The app lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat.
  * Whenever a user submits a burger's name, the app will display the burger on the left side of the page -- waiting to be devoured.
  * Each burger in the waiting area also has a Devour it! button. When the user clicks it, the burger will move to the right side of the page.
  * The app will store every burger in a database, whether devoured or not.
